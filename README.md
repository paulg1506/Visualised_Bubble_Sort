## Visualised Bubble Sort Script ##

A python script to visualise a bubble sorting algorithm.
Uses pygame to visualise the process of a bubble sort.
Shows three different sorts simultaneously. Sorts by Hue, Length, and Darkness/lightness of bars.

Requires pygame to work.

TODO Add timers, pass count, and swaps for each sort type.

TODO Add if statement to sort to check if passes equals 0 after going
through entire list. If true list is sorted and should not be iterated
through again.

TODO Add values for timers, passes, swaps to display after sort complete.
